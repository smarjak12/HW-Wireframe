/This page is not complete. I have been struggling with floats and css properties which is why I decided to go with the easier homework assignment. I started the recommended homework assignment but even felt more lost in that assignment. I feel like I have fallen behind some but am going to try to catch up these next  couple of days before saturday class. Any advice or anything would be appreciated. thanks/
